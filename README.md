## PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT: 


I attempt to challenge myself to build a small piece of UI everyday using React in order to practice and improve my understanding of ReactJS and CSS. I called it UI challenge! 

UI Challenge 4 (26.11/2021): UI User Textarea 
View demo: https://thanhnguyenn.github.io/UI-challenge-4/.
This challenge was using QuillJs to build the textarea which it allows user to format their input before submitting.
